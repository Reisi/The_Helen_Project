The Helen Project is a firmware platform for bicycle lights.
It features

- up to 8 modes, each individually configurable
- the modes can be split into groups
- support for remote control connected over BLE
- mode and group configurations with The Helen App
- light-to-light connections with mode synchronization

Currently there are two devices:

- [Helen](HELEN.md), an alternative electronic circuit for the Yinding or KD2 headlight cycling lamps
- [Drake](https://github.com/Reisi/Drake), a multi-purpose PCB, which can be used to build a rear light or a dropper post actuator
